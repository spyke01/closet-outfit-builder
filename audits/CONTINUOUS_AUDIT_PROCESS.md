# Continuous Audit and Monitoring Process

## Overview

This document outlines the continuous audit and monitoring process established for the Closet Outfit Builder application. The process ensures ongoing code quality, security, accessibility, and performance through automated checks and regular audits.

## Audit Components

### 1. Pre-commit Hooks

**Purpose**: Catch issues early in the development process before code is committed.

**What it checks**:
- TypeScript type safety
- ESLint code quality violations
- Accessibility compliance (jsx-a11y)
- Security vulnerabilities (high/critical only)
- Common code issues (console.log, debugger, TODO comments)

**Usage**:
```bash
# Setup pre-commit hooks (one-time setup)
npm run audit:setup-hooks

# Test pre-commit checks manually
npm run audit:pre-commit

# Bypass hooks (not recommended)
git commit --no-verify
```

### 2. Continuous Audit Script

**Purpose**: Comprehensive audit covering all aspects of code quality, security, and compliance.

**What it checks**:
- **Security**: NPM vulnerabilities, outdated packages
- **Code Quality**: ESLint violations, TypeScript compliance, test coverage
- **Accessibility**: A11y linting, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility
- **Build & Performance**: Production build success, bundle analysis

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run full continuous audit
npm run audit:continuous

# View audit results
ls audits/continuous-audit-*.json
cat audits/latest-audit-report.json
```

### 3. Audit Scheduler

**Purpose**: Manage scheduled audits and track trends over time.

**Features**:
- Configurable audit schedules (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Trend analysis and reporting
- Threshold monitoring with alerts
- Historical audit data tracking

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run scheduled audit manually
npm run audit:schedule run

# Generate trends report
npm run audit:trends

# Check schedule status
npm run audit:status

# View configuration
cat audits/audit-schedule.json
```

## Audit Schedule

### Default Schedule

- **Daily** (9:00 AM): Security and quality checks
- **Weekly** (Monday 8:00 AM): Full audit including accessibility and build
- **Monthly** (1st day 7:00 AM): Comprehensive audit with documentation sync

### Customization

Edit `audits/audit-schedule.json` to customize:
- Schedule timing and frequency
- Which checks to run for each schedule
- Alert thresholds
- Notification settings

```json
{
  "daily": {
    "enabled": true,
    "time": "09:00",
    "checks": ["security", "quality"]
  },
  "thresholds": {
    "criticalIssues": 0,
    "failedChecks": 3,
    "coverageThreshold": 80
  }
}
```

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: Continuous Audit
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * *' # Daily at 9 AM

jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run audit:continuous
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          name: audit-reports
          path: audits/
```

### Netlify Build Integration

Add to `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run audit:continuous && npm run build"
  
[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-lighthouse"
  
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Threshold Configuration

The system monitors key metrics and alerts when thresholds are exceeded:

- **Critical Issues**: 0 (any critical security vulnerability triggers alert)
- **Failed Checks**: 3 (more than 3 failed audit checks)
- **Test Coverage**: 80% (below 80% coverage triggers alert)

### Alert Channels

Configure notifications in `audits/audit-schedule.json`:

```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "email": "team@example.com",
    "slack": "https://hooks.slack.com/...",
    "webhook": "https://api.example.com/alerts"
  }
}
```

## Trend Analysis

### Metrics Tracked

- **Pass Rate**: Percentage of successful audit checks over time
- **Critical Issues**: Number of critical security vulnerabilities
- **Failed Checks**: Number of failed audit checks
- **Test Coverage**: Code coverage percentage trends

### Reports Generated

- **Audit Trends Report**: `audits/audit-trends.json`
- **Individual Audit Reports**: `audits/continuous-audit-YYYY-MM-DD-*.json`
- **Latest Report**: `audits/latest-audit-report.json`

### Insights

The system automatically generates insights such as:
- "Critical issues are increasing over time"
- "Test coverage is improving"
- "Excellent audit pass rate (>90%)"
- "Inconsistent audit results - consider process improvements"

## Team Adoption Guide

### For New Team Members

1. **Setup**: Run `npm run audit:setup-hooks` after cloning the repository
2. **Understanding**: Review this document and the audit configuration
3. **Daily Workflow**: Pre-commit hooks will run automatically; fix any issues before committing
4. **Monitoring**: Check audit reports regularly, especially after major changes

### For Project Leads

1. **Configuration**: Customize audit schedules and thresholds based on team needs
2. **Monitoring**: Review trend reports weekly to identify patterns
3. **Process Improvement**: Use audit insights to improve development practices
4. **Training**: Ensure team understands audit process and how to resolve common issues

### For DevOps/CI Engineers

2. **Notifications**: Configure alert channels for critical issues
3. **Scheduling**: Set up automated audit runs using cron jobs or CI schedulers
4. **Reporting**: Integrate audit reports with existing monitoring dashboards

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Pre-commit hook fails**:
- Run `npm run audit:pre-commit` to see specific issues
- Fix ESLint violations: `npm run lint`
- Fix TypeScript errors: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Update dependencies: `npm audit fix`

**Continuous audit fails**:
- Check individual audit components
- Review error messages in audit reports
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Verify build configuration

**Missing audit reports**:
- Ensure `audits/` directory exists
- Check file permissions
- Verify script execution permissions

### Getting Help

1. **Documentation**: Review audit reports for specific error details
2. **Logs**: Check console output during audit execution
3. **Configuration**: Verify audit configuration files are valid JSON
4. **Dependencies**: Ensure all required packages are installed

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

- **Weekly**: Review audit trends and address declining metrics
- **Monthly**: Update audit thresholds based on project evolution
- **Quarterly**: Review and update audit process documentation
- **As Needed**: Update audit scripts when adding new tools or checks

### Updating the Process

1. **Script Updates**: Modify audit scripts in `scripts/` directory
2. **Configuration**: Update `audits/audit-schedule.json` for schedule changes
3. **Documentation**: Update this document when process changes
4. **Testing**: Test changes with `npm run audit:pre-commit` and `npm run audit:continuous`

## Metrics and Success Criteria

### Key Performance Indicators
