# Audit Process Quick Start Guide

## ðŸš€ Getting Started (5 minutes)

### 1. Setup Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
npm run audit:setup-hooks
```
This installs Git hooks that automatically check code quality before each commit.

### 2. Run Your First Audit
```bash
npm run audit:continuous
```
This runs a comprehensive audit and generates a report in the `audits/` directory.

### 3. Check Results
```bash
npm run audit:status
```
View audit schedule status and recent results.

## ðŸ“‹ Daily Workflow

### Before Committing Code
Pre-commit hooks run automatically, but you can test manually:
```bash
npm run audit:pre-commit
```

### Fix Common Issues
```bash
# Fix ESLint violations
npm run lint

# Check TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Fix security vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# Run accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y
```

## ðŸ”§ Available Commands

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `npm run audit:setup-hooks` | Install Git pre-commit hooks | Once after cloning repo |
| `npm run audit:pre-commit` | Quick pre-commit checks | Before committing code |
| `npm run audit:continuous` | Full comprehensive audit | Weekly or before releases |
| `npm run audit:schedule run` | Run scheduled audit | Manual audit execution |
| `npm run audit:trends` | Generate trends report | Monthly review |
| `npm run audit:status` | Show audit status | Check current state |

## ðŸŽ¯ Understanding Results

### Audit Report Structure
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "totalChecks": 10,
    "passedChecks": 8,
    "failedChecks": 2,
    "criticalIssues": 0
  },
  "recommendations": [
    "Fix ESLint violations to improve code quality"
  ]
}
```

### Priority Levels
- ðŸ”´ **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, build failures
- ðŸŸ¡ **High**: Code quality issues, accessibility violations
- ðŸŸ¢ **Low**: Style issues, minor optimizations

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues & Solutions

### "Pre-commit hook failed"
**Cause**: Code quality issues detected
**Solution**: 
1. Run `npm run audit:pre-commit` to see details
2. Fix reported issues
3. Commit again

### "TypeScript errors found"
**Cause**: Type safety violations
**Solution**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` and fix type errors

### "Security vulnerabilities detected"
**Cause**: Outdated or vulnerable dependencies
**Solution**: Run `npm audit fix` to update packages

### "Accessibility violations found"
**Cause**: WCAG compliance issues
**Solution**: 
1. Run `npm run lint:a11y` for details
2. Add proper ARIA labels, alt text, etc.
3. Test with `npm run test:keyboard`

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Your Progress

### View Latest Results
```bash
# Check latest audit report
cat audits/latest-audit-report.json

# View trends over time
npm run audit:trends
```

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Pass Rate**: Aim for >95%
- **Critical Issues**: Keep at 0
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >80%
- **Failed Checks**: Keep under 3

## ðŸ”„ Integration Tips

### For VS Code Users
Add to `.vscode/tasks.json`:
```json
{
  "label": "Run Audit",
  "type": "shell",
  "command": "npm run audit:pre-commit",
