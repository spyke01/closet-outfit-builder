## Data Structure

### Database Schema (Supabase PostgreSQL)

- **Display Order**: Custom ordering for UI
- **User Ownership**: Private to each user

#### Outfits
Complete outfit combinations with:
- **User Ownership**: Private outfit collections
- **Item References**: Links to wardrobe items via junction table
- **Scoring**: Calculated compatibility scores
- **Tuck Style**: Tucked/Untucked preferences
- **Source**: Curated vs generated outfits
- **Loved Status**: User favorites

#### User Preferences

- **Location Data**: Coordinates from browser geolocation or address input
- **Authenticated Access**: Weather features only available to logged-in users

## Core Features

### 7-Category Layering System

The wardrobe uses a realistic layering hierarchy that matches how clothing is actually worn:

1. **Jacket/Overshirt** (outermost layer)
2. **Shirt** (middle layer)
3. **Undershirt** (base layer) - for t-shirts and base layers
4. **Pants** (lower body)
5. **Shoes** (footwear)
6. **Belt** (accessories)
7. **Watch** (accessories)

This structure allows for accurate outfit composition and reflects real-world dressing patterns.

### Layer-Aware Scoring Algorithm

The scoring system accounts for how clothing layers interact:

- **Visibility Weighting**: Items covered by other layers have reduced impact on formality scores
  - Undershirt covered by shirt: 30% weight
  - Shirt covered by jacket: 70% weight
  - Visible items: 100% weight
- **Transparent Scoring**: Score breakdown shows individual item contributions and applied weights
- **Layer Adjustments**: Clear indication of why certain items have reduced scoring impact

### Visual Outfit Display

Interactive flip cards provide visual outfit representations:

- **Proper Layering**: Visual stacking matches clothing hierarchy (jacket over shirt over undershirt)
- **Flip Animation**: Smooth transitions between text-based and visual outfit views
- **Responsive Design**: Visual layouts adapt to different screen sizes

### Brand Management System

Optional brand tracking for wardrobe organization:

- **Brand Field**: Optional brand information for each wardrobe item
- **Flexible Display**: Items work with or without brand information
- **Consistent Formatting**: "Brand Item (Color)" format when brands are shown
- **Settings Integration**: User can toggle brand display on/off globally

### User Settings

Customizable preferences for personalized experience:

- **Settings Page**: Dedicated interface for managing user preferences
- **Brand Display Toggle**: Show or hide brand information throughout the app
- **Persistent Storage**: Settings saved locally and persist across sessions
- **Immediate Updates**: Changes take effect instantly without page refresh

## Development

### Database Development

#### Adding New Items
1. Use the web interface to upload items with photos
2. Items are automatically processed with background removal
3. All data is stored in Supabase with user isolation
4. Categories are user-specific and customizable

#### Database Migrations
```bash
# Create new migration
supabase migration new migration_name

# Apply migrations locally
supabase db reset

# Apply to production
supabase db push --linked
```

#### Edge Functions Development
```bash
# Create new Edge Function
supabase functions new function-name

# Deploy Edge Function
supabase functions deploy function-name

# Test locally
supabase functions serve
```

### Authentication Development

#### Testing Authentication Flows
```bash
# Test with different user accounts
# Use Supabase dashboard to manage test users
# Verify RLS policies are working correctly
```

### Legacy Data Migration

#### Converting Static Data (if needed)
1. Use the seed-user Edge Function for initial data population
2. Import existing JSON data through the web interface
3. Ensure proper user association and category mapping

### Adding Images to Your Wardrobe

#### Automatic Background Removal
1. Upload images directly through the web interface
2. Custom background removal processing happens automatically
3. Fallback to original image if processing fails
4. Images are stored securely in Supabase Storage

#### Manual Image Processing (if needed)
1. Use ChatGPT or another tool to generate wardrobe item images
2. Upload through the web interface for automatic processing
3. Alternative: Use [Remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/) for manual background removal
4. Use [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to compress images before upload

### Weather Service Integration

The weather service (`lib/hooks/use-weather.ts`) provides:
- Location-based weather fetching via browser geolocation
- Integration with Netlify Functions for secure API access
- Caching and retry logic for improved reliability
- Error handling for various failure scenarios

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests once
npm run test:run

# Test specific features
npm test -- --grep "weather"
npm test -- --grep "WeatherWidget"
npm test -- --grep "scoring"
npm test -- --grep "OutfitCard"
npm test -- --grep "SettingsPage"
```

### Customizing Styles

The app uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Key customization areas:
- Modify component classes for visual changes
- Extend `tailwind.config.ts` for custom breakpoints or utilities
- Update responsive design breakpoints in components
- Customize weather widget appearance and layout

## Building for Production

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Preview the production build locally
npm run preview
```

This creates an optimized build in the `out/` directory with:
- Minified JavaScript and CSS
- Optimized assets and images
- Service worker for PWA functionality
- Netlify Functions compiled and ready for deployment

## Deployment

### Production Deployment

1. **Set up production Supabase project:**
   - Create new Supabase project for production
   - Apply database migrations: `supabase db push`
   - Configure Row Level Security policies
   - Deploy Edge Functions: `supabase functions deploy`

2. **Configure environment variables in your deployment platform:**
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_production_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_anon_key
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_production_api_key
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

3. **Deploy to Netlify/Vercel:**
   ```bash
   # Build for production
   npm run build
   
   # Deploy (platform-specific)
   netlify deploy --prod
   # or
   vercel --prod
   ```

4. **Verify deployment:**
   ```bash
   # Test production deployment
   npm run verify:production
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Development Issues

**Functions Not Working Locally:**
```bash
npm run dev:netlify  # Use this instead of npm run dev for weather features
```

**Environment Variables:**
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add your API keys
- Restart dev server after changing environment variables

**Build Failures:**
```bash
# Check Node.js version (should be 20+)
node --version

# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf .next node_modules
npm install && npm run build
```

**Weather API Issues:**
- Verify OpenWeatherMap API key is valid
- Check API usage limits (1,000 calls/day free tier)
- Ensure location permissions are granted in browser

## PWA Features

The application includes:
- Service worker for offline functionality
- Web app manifest for installation capability
- Responsive design optimized for mobile devices
- Caching strategies for improved performance
